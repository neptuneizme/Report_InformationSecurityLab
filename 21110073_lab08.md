<div style="text-align: justify">
Firstly, after access into router, I list initial policy of iptables

<br>
<br>Secondly, I setup rules on router to block access into it except ping: </br>
- <span style="color:green">iptables -P INPUT DROP</span>: This command sets the default policy for incoming traffic (INPUT chain) to DROP. This means that if a packet does not match any  specific rule, it will be dropped or denied
- <span style="color:green">iptables -P OUTPUT DROP</span>: Similarly, this command sets the default policy for outgoing traffic (OUTPUT chain) to DROP. This means that if a packet does not match any specific rule, it will be dropped or denied.
- <span style="color:green">iptables -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type 8 -j ACCEPT</span>: This rule allows incoming ICMP Echo Request (ping) packets. It permits incoming ICMP packets with type 8, which are used for ping requests. These packets are accepted (ALLOWed).
- <span style="color:green">iptables -A OUTPUT -p icmp --icmp-type 0 -j ACCEPT</span>: This rule allows outgoing ICMP Echo Reply packets, which are responses to ping requests. It permits outgoing ICMP packets with type 0, which are the responses to ping requests. These packets are accepted (ALLOWed).
- <span style="color:green">iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j DROP</span>: This rule drops (DENYs) incoming TCP traffic on port 80. Port 80 is commonly used for HTTP web traffic. So, this rule is blocking incoming web traffic.
- <span style="color:green">iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 23 -j DROP</span>: This rule drops (DENYs) incoming TCP traffic on port 23. Port 23 is commonly used for Telnet. So, this rule is blocking incoming Telnet traffic.
- <span style="color:green">iptables -A INPUT -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT</span>: This rule allows incoming traffic that is part of an existing or related connection. For example, if your system initiates an outgoing connection to a remote server, this rule allows the response traffic back into your system. It is used for established and related connections.
- <span style="color:green">iptables -A OUTPUT -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT</span>: Similar to the previous rule, this one allows outgoing traffic that is part of an existing or related connection, ensuring that responses to outgoing requests are allowed back into your system.

Thirdly, I check again list policy of iptables.

Finally, when I access into outsider-10.9.0.5 and as you can see, all access into router are blocked except ping

# Task b. Setup rules on router to prevent computers on subnet 10.9.0.0/24 from accessing the internal web server.

I continue to access into router to setup rules to prevent computers on subnet 10.9.0.0/24 from accessing the iweb-172.16.10.110 by using the below command: 
- <span style="color:green"> iptables -A FORWARD -s 10.9.0.0/24 -d 172.16.10.110 -j DROP</span>: This rule targets the FORWARD chain, which handles packets passing through the system (typically from one network interface to another). It specifies that any packet originating from the IP range 10.9.0.0/24 and destined for 172.16.10.110 should be dropped or denied when attempting to traverse the system. This rule restricts forwarding traffic from the specified source network to the specified destination IP address.
- Running <span style="color:green"> iptables -F</span> will clear all the rules in the <span style="color:green">filter</span> table, essentially resetting the firewall rules to an empty state. This means that any rules that were set up to allow or block specific traffic will be removed, and the default policy will take effect. If the default policy is to accept all traffic, then flushing the rules will effectively open up the firewall to all incoming and outgoing traffic, which may not be desirable from a security perspective.

After setting up, I can check by accessing into outsider and try access into iweb and we've done Task b

![img8b2](https://github.com/neptuneizme/Report_InformationSecurityLab/blob/main/img/lab8b2.png?raw=true)
# Task c. The badsite was found to contain malwares and source of delivering bots. Setup rules on router to stop computers on subnet 172.16.10.0/24 from accessing the badsite.
## Notes: Outsider computer (external) still can telnet into iweb (internal), inner computer (internal) still can telnet into outsider
In router, I setup some below rules to stop computer on subnet 172.16.10.0/24 from accessing the badsite but outsider computer still can telnet into iweb and inner computer still can telnet into outsider.
- <span style="color:green">iptables -P INPUT DROP</span>: This command sets the default policy for incoming traffic (INPUT chain) to DROP. This means that unless a packet matches a specific rule allowing it, all incoming traffic will be denied.
- <span style="color:green">iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT</span>: This command sets the default policy for forwarding traffic (FORWARD chain) to ACCEPT. It means that any traffic passing through the system (from one network interface to another) will be allowed by default unless specific rules block it.
- <span style="color:green">iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT</span>: This rule allows all traffic on the loopback interface (lo), which is used for local communication within the same system. It permits traffic that originates and terminates on the same machine (localhost) to be accepted.
- <span style="color:green">iptables -A FORWARD -s 172.16.10.0/24 -d 10.9.0.5 -j ACCEPT</span>: This rule allows forwarding of packets originating from the source subnet 172.16.10.0/24 to the destination IP address 10.9.0.5. It permits this specific traffic to be forwarded through the system.
- <span style="color:green">iptables -A FORWARD -s 172.16.10.0/24 -d 10.9.0.10 -j DROP</span>: This rule blocks forwarding of packets from the source subnet 172.16.10.0/24 to the destination IP address 10.9.0.10. It denies this specific traffic from being forwarded.
- <span style="color:green">iptables -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT</span>: This rule allows incoming traffic that is part of an established or related connection. It permits responses to outgoing connections and established connections to be accepted.

After that, I access into inner computer and try to access to badsite-10.9.0.10, and as you can see, all access are blocked.

![img8c2](https://github.com/neptuneizme/Report_InformationSecurityLab/blob/main/img/lab8c2.png?raw=true)

But outsider computer (external) still can telnet into iweb (internal), inner computer (internal) still can telnet into outsider.
